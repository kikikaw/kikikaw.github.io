    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <span>
            <p>Scrape off the scales from the fish and cut off the sharp fins. 
                 Make diagonal cuts along both sides.  Wash and dry thoroughly.  
                 Place a sprig of rosemary in the cavity of each of the smaller fish 
                 with half the lemon slices; or two sprigs and all the lemon 
                 in the large fish.</p>
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
            <p>To grill (broil), place in a foil-lined pan, 
                brush lightly with 1-2 tablespoons oil and grill (broil) 
                under a moderate heat for about 5 minutes each side 
                or until cooked through, turning carefully.</p>
            <p class="time">Time: 10 minutes</p>
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>
            <p><strong>To bake:</strong>  place the fish in a foil-lined dish
                or roasting tin brushed with oil, and brush the fish 
                with the rest of the oil.  Cook in a preheated oven, 
                190°C/375°F/Gas Mark 5 for about 30 minutes
                for the small fish or 45-50 minutes for the large fish,
                until the thickest part of the fish is opaque.
            </p>
            <p class="time">Time: 30-50 minutes</p>

        <li>
            <span>
            <p><strong>For the sauce:</strong>  crush the salt and capers 
                with the garlic in a pestle and mortar if available
                and then gradually work in the water.  Alternatively,
                put it all in a food processor or blender
                and switch on until smooth.</p>
            </span>

            <span>
            <p>Bruise the bays leaves and remaining sprigs of rosemary 
                and put in a bowl.  Add the garlic mixture,
                lemon juice or vinegar and oil and pound
                together until the flavours are released.  
                Season with pepper.
            </p>
            </span>

            <span>
            <p>Place the fish on a serving dish and, if liked,
                carefully remove the skin.  Spoon some of the 
                sauce over the fish and serve the rest separately.  
                Garnish with fresh bay leaves nd lemon wedges.
            </p>
